The core of my ChainStrategies Framework is effectively a re-elaboration of those six key questions, making them focus on a facet of the technology, rather than at the technology as a whole. This allows a much finer grained reasoning in terms of strategic advantages.

I summarize the reformulated questions in a canvas: the Power of Innovation Canvas. It is a simple canvas that can be completed for any innovative power that we can identify, by dissecting the capabilities of different Blockchain Technologies.

All in all, I identified nine fundamental Powers of Innovation, including:

+ Digital Ownership
+ Decentralization
+ Transaction Finality
+ Notarization
+ Tokenization
+ Fractionalization
+ Decentralized Computation
+ Public/Private Keys
+ Identity and Identity of Things


Then I collect the nine powers in a matrix that I call the Innovative Powers and Opportunities Map. 
This is the primary tool that can be used to reason about how to design a Blockchain Strategy, or how to assess the value of any proposition in this space.

a Lean Startup Canvas describing the plans of a real startup. 

Through this actual case, you will be able to appreciate how - in general -
I assess the value propositions of new startups that promote innovative solutions based on Blockchain Technologies.

In addition to the use case of assessing startup business plans, we need to consider that Blockchain Technologies can potentially unleash industry wide transformations in a number of industry sectors, such as:
+ Financial Services;
+ Supply Chain Management;
+ Insurance;
+ Media; Assets/Titles;
+ identity;
+ Internet of Things;
+ Payments;
+ Consumer Promotion/Marketing/Loyalty;
+ Resources (Energy, waste, water management);
+ Government/Public Services and Public Records.
